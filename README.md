Alien Invasion Game
This is a classic arcade game, "Alien Invasion," built with Python and the Pygame library.

Features
Control a ship at the bottom of the screen.

Shoot bullets to destroy fleets of aliens.

Score points for each alien destroyed.

The game's difficulty increases with each level.

Tracks your score and the all-time high score.

The high score is saved and persists across game sessions.

How to Run
Install Pygame: If you don't have it, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

pip install pygame

Create Image Folder: In the same directory where you save these Python files, create a new folder named images.

Add Images: You need to find or create two small image files and place them inside the images folder:

ship.bmp: An image for the player's ship.

alien.bmp: An image for the alien enemies.

Tip: For best results, use bitmap (.bmp) images and make sure their background color is the same as the game's background ((230, 230, 230) which is a light gray). This will make them look like they have a transparent background.

Run the Game: Open your terminal, navigate to the folder containing all the files, and run the main script:

python alien_invasion.py

Controls
Left/Right Arrow Keys: Move the ship.

Spacebar: Fire bullets.

Q Key: Quit the game.

Mouse: Click the "Play" button to start.
