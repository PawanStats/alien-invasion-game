How to Run

Install Pygame: If you don’t have it, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

pip install pygame

Create Image Folder: In the same directory where you save these python files, create a new folder named images.

Add Images: You have to find or create two small image files. Place them into the images folder:

ship.bmp: A image for the player’s ship.

alien.bmp: A image for the alien enemies.

Tip: For best results, utilize bitmap (.bmp) images and ensure their background color matches the game’s background color ((230, 230, 230) which is a light gray). This will enhance the effect of them being a transparent background.

Launching the Game: To get started, open your terminal, go to the directory where all the files are located, and run the main script as follows:

python alien_invasion.py

How to Control the Game

You can control the ship with the Left and right arrow keys: the left arrow key moves the ship left, the right arrow key moves the ship right. To fire bullets at the enemy, press the spacebar on the keyboard. You can exit the game by pressing the ‘Q’ key on your keyboard. When you want to start the game, use your mouse to click the "Play" button.
